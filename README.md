# Hey there, I’m Ryan

I’m currently studying **Computer Engineering** at UC San Diego. I build cool, meaningful tech that bridges hardware and software.

## 🛠 What I’ve Worked On

### 🚁 Medical Payload Delivery Drone  
I built a drone that can carry a 1.5 lb medical payload — imagine speeding up non-emergency rescue delivery times by 25%. It’s got remote control up to a mile, a custom PCB I designed in KiCad, and it reads orientation/rotation using an MPU6000. I worked on the firmware in **Arduino C** and used **Python** for testing and data handling.

### 🧠 Kernel Dev (OS stuff)  
Low-level systems. Built out a kernel with threading, system calls, and even demand-paged virtual memory in **C/C++**, and learned a ton about scheduling, synchronization, and memory efficiency.

### 📸 3D Reconstruction + ML  
Used photometric stereo and the horn integration method to build depth maps of faces. Also derived epipolar geometry using the 8-point algorithm for image matching. Trained a CNN on MNIST using **PyTorch** and hit 99%+ accuracy. Optimizers, dropout, and transfer learning too.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Languages:** Java, JavaScript, C, C++, Python, Rust, Verilog  
**Frameworks/Libraries:** React, PyTorch, OpenCV, sklearn  
**Domains:** VLSI, PCB Design, Laser Cutting, Embedded Systems, ML
